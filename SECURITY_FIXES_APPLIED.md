# Security Fixes Applied - October 9, 2025

## Summary

Comprehensive security and performance review completed for DMZ deployment readiness. All critical and high-priority issues have been resolved. The application is now ready for production DMZ deployment.

---

## ‚úÖ Fixes Applied

### CRITICAL Issues - FIXED

#### ‚úÖ CRITICAL-1: HTTPS Redirect When HTTPS Disabled
**File:** `src/ZLFileRelay.WebPortal/Program.cs`

**Before:**
```csharp
app.UseHttpsRedirection();  // Always called, breaks HTTP-only mode
```

**After:**
```csharp
// SECURITY FIX (CRITICAL-1): Only use HTTPS redirection if HTTPS is enabled
if (appConfig.WebPortal.Kestrel.EnableHttps)
{
    app.UseHttpsRedirection();
}
```

**Impact:** Service will now work correctly in HTTP-only mode (DMZ scenario)

---

#### ‚úÖ CRITICAL-2: Missing Security Settings in Configuration
**File:** `appsettings.json`

**Added Missing Settings:**
```json
"Security": {
  "AllowExecutableFiles": false,      // NEW
  "AllowHiddenFiles": false,          // NEW
  "MaxUploadSizeBytes": 5368709120    // NEW (5GB)
}
```

**Impact:** Prevents runtime errors from missing configuration values

---

### HIGH Priority Issues - FIXED

#### ‚úÖ HIGH-1: Added Security Headers for DMZ Deployment
**File:** `src/ZLFileRelay.WebPortal/Program.cs`

**Added Headers:**
- `X-Frame-Options: DENY` - Prevents clickjacking
- `X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff` - Prevents MIME sniffing
- `X-XSS-Protection: 1; mode=block` - XSS protection
- `Content-Security-Policy` - Restrictive CSP for file upload app
- `Referrer-Policy: strict-origin-when-cross-origin` - Controls referrer info
- `Permissions-Policy` - Disables unnecessary browser features

**Implementation:**
```csharp
app.Use(async (context, next) =>
{
    context.Response.Headers["X-Frame-Options"] = "DENY";
    context.Response.Headers["X-Content-Type-Options"] = "nosniff";
    context.Response.Headers["X-XSS-Protection"] = "1; mode=block";
    context.Response.Headers["Content-Security-Policy"] = 
        "default-src 'self'; script-src 'self' 'unsafe-inline'; style-src 'self' 'unsafe-inline'; img-src 'self' data:; font-src 'self'; frame-ancestors 'none'";
    context.Response.Headers["Referrer-Policy"] = "strict-origin-when-cross-origin";
    context.Response.Headers["Permissions-Policy"] = 
        "geolocation=(), microphone=(), camera=(), payment=(), usb=(), magnetometer=(), gyroscope=()";
    await next();
});
```

**Impact:** Protects against clickjacking, XSS, MIME sniffing, and other web-based attacks

---

#### ‚úÖ HIGH-2: Improved Error Handling
**File:** `src/ZLFileRelay.WebPortal/Program.cs`

**Before:**
```csharp
if (!app.Environment.IsDevelopment())
{
    app.UseExceptionHandler("/Error");
    app.UseHsts();
}
```

**After:**
```csharp
if (app.Environment.IsDevelopment())
{
    app.UseDeveloperExceptionPage();  // Detailed errors in dev
}
else
{
    // In production, use generic error page (no technical details)
    app.UseExceptionHandler(errorApp =>
    {
        errorApp.Run(async context =>
        {
            context.Response.StatusCode = 500;
            context.Response.ContentType = "text/html";
            
            await context.Response.WriteAsync(@"
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
    <title>Error - ZL File Relay</title>
    <style>...</style>
</head>
<body>
    <div class='error-container'>
        <h1>An Error Occurred</h1>
        <p>We're sorry, but something went wrong...</p>
        <p><a href='/Upload'>Return to Upload Page</a></p>
    </div>
</body>
</html>");
        });
    });
    
    if (appConfig.WebPortal.Kestrel.EnableHttps)
    {
        app.UseHsts();
    }
}
```

**Impact:** Prevents information disclosure through error messages in production

---

### MEDIUM Priority Issues - FIXED

#### ‚úÖ MEDIUM-1: Added Request Body Size Limit at Kestrel Level
**File:** `src/ZLFileRelay.WebPortal/Program.cs`

**Added:**
```csharp
builder.WebHost.ConfigureKestrel(options =>
{
    // SECURITY FIX (MEDIUM-1): Set request body size limit at Kestrel level
    options.Limits.MaxRequestBodySize = appConfig.Security.MaxUploadSizeBytes;
});
```

**Impact:** Prevents memory exhaustion from extremely large requests
