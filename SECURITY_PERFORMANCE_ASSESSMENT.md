# ZL File Relay - Security & Performance Assessment
## DMZ Deployment Readiness Review

**Date:** October 9, 2025  
**Reviewed Components:** WebPortal, Service, Core, ConfigTool  
**Target Environment:** DMZ Server with SCADA/OT Network Access

---

## Executive Summary

Overall security posture: **EXCELLENT** - Ready for DMZ deployment.  
The application has solid security fundamentals in place. All critical and high-priority issues have been resolved.

### ‚úÖ Critical Issues: 2 (All Fixed)
### ‚úÖ High Priority: 2 (All Fixed)
### ‚úÖ Medium Priority: 3 Fixed, 1 Acceptable
### üü¢ Low Priority: 3 (All Acceptable)

**Status:** ‚úÖ **PRODUCTION READY** for DMZ deployment

---

## CRITICAL Issues (Must Fix Before Deployment)

### üî¥ CRITICAL-1: HTTPS Redirect When HTTPS Disabled - #COMPLETED#
**File:** `src/ZLFileRelay.WebPortal/Program.cs:141`

**Issue:** The app calls `UseHttpsRedirection()` unconditionally, even when HTTPS is disabled in configuration. This will cause redirect loops or errors when running HTTP-only.

**Impact:** Service unavailable if HTTPS is not configured properly.

**Fix Required:**
```csharp
// Only use HTTPS redirection if HTTPS is enabled
if (appConfig.WebPortal.Kestrel.EnableHttps)
{
    app.UseHttpsRedirection();
}
```

---

### üî¥ CRITICAL-2: Missing Security Settings in Configuration - #COMPLETED#
**File:** `appsettings.json`

**Issue:** Security configuration section is incomplete. Missing critical settings:
- `AllowExecutableFiles`
- `AllowHiddenFiles`  
- `MaxUploadSizeBytes`

**Impact:** Code references these settings but they're not defined, causing potential NullReferenceException.

**Fix Required:** Add complete Security section to appsettings.json

---

## HIGH Priority Issues

### ‚úÖ HIGH-1: Missing Security Headers [FIXED]
**File:** `src/ZLFileRelay.WebPortal/Program.cs`

**Issue:** Missing critical security headers for DMZ deployment:
- X-Content-Type-Options
- X-Frame-Options
- X-XSS-Protection
- Content-Security-Policy
- Referrer-Policy

**Status:** ‚úÖ **FIXED** - All security headers implemented (lines 209-233), including bonus Permissions-Policy header.

---

### ‚úÖ HIGH-2: Error Page Information Disclosure [FIXED]
**File:** `src/ZLFileRelay.WebPortal/Program.cs:154-201`

**Issue:** The current error handling might expose stack traces in non-development environments if not configured properly.

**Status:** ‚úÖ **FIXED** - Custom error pages with generic messages in production. No technical details exposed.

---

## MEDIUM Priority Issues

### ‚úÖ MEDIUM-1: Missing Request Body Size Limit [FIXED]
**File:** `src/ZLFileRelay.WebPortal/Program.cs`

**Issue:** While file size is validated at the application level, there's no Kestrel-level body size limit. Attackers could send extremely large requests to exhaust memory.

**Status:** ‚úÖ **FIXED** - MaxRequestBodySize configured at Kestrel level (lines 50, 65, 77).

---

### ‚úÖ MEDIUM-2: File Extension Validation Order [FIXED]
**File:** `src/ZLFileRelay.WebPortal/Services/FileUploadService.cs:43-55`

**Issue:** File extension validation happens AFTER opening the stream and checking size. While not critical (size limit provides protection), extension should be checked first for efficiency.

**Status:** ‚úÖ **FIXED** - Validation reordered: extension check now happens before size check.

---

### ‚úÖ MEDIUM-3: No Rate Limiting on Authentication [FIXED]
**File:** `src/ZLFileRelay.WebPortal/Program.cs`

**Issue:** Rate limiting is only applied to upload endpoint. No rate limiting on authentication/authorization checks.

**Status:** ‚úÖ **FIXED** - Global rate limiter implemented (lines 122-135). 100 requests/minute per IP protects against brute force and DoS.

---

### üü° MEDIUM-4: Large Directory Performance
**File:** `src/ZLFileRelay.Service/Services/FileWatcher.cs`

**Issue:** FileSystemWatcher can be inefficient with very large directories (1000+ files) or high-frequency file operations.

**Impact:** CPU/memory spikes during high-volume operations.

**Recommendation:** Current implementation is acceptable for typical use. Monitor in production.

---

## LOW Priority Issues

### üü¢ LOW-1: Certificate Password in Configuration
**File:** `appsettings.json:121`

**Issue:** Certificate password stored in plain text in configuration file.

**Current Status:** Actually acceptable since:
1. appsettings.json should have restricted file permissions
2. DPAPI is for user credentials, not service certificates
3. Standard practice for certificate passwords in configuration

**Recommendation:** Document that appsettings.json must have restricted ACLs.

---

### üü¢ LOW-2: Timer Exception Handling
**File:** `src/ZLFileRelay.Service/Services/TransferWorker.cs`

**Issue:** Timer callbacks have exception handling, but could be more robust.

**Current Status:** Acceptable - exceptions are caught and logged.

**Recommendation:** No change needed, current implementation is fine.

---

### üü¢ LOW-3: Session/Cookie Configuration
**File:** `src/ZLFileRelay.WebPortal/Program.cs`

**Issue:** No explicit session or cookie configuration.

**Current Status:** Since the app uses Windows Authentication and doesn't store session data, this is acceptable.

**Recommendation:** Add explicit cookie security settings if sessions are added in future.

---

## Performance Assessment

### ‚úÖ **Good Performance Characteristics:**

1. **Async/Await Throughout** - All I/O operations properly async
2. **Rate Limiting** - Protects against upload floods
3. **Semaphore Pattern** - Prevents concurrent processing conflicts
4. **Connection Pooling** - SSH connections properly managed
5. **Memory Cleanup** - Timer-based cleanup of stale queue entries
6. **Resource Disposal** - Proper IDisposable patterns

### ‚ö†Ô∏è **Potential Performance Concerns:**

1. **Large File Uploads** - 5GB max could exhaust memory on constrained systems
   - **Mitigation:** Already streams files (not buffered in memory)
   
2. **Concurrent Transfer Limit** - Default 5 concurrent transfers
   - **Status:** Configurable, appropriate for DMZ environment

3. **Log File Growth** - 30-day retention with 100MB max
   - **Status:** Acceptable, monitored by retention policy

---

## Security Best Practices Already Implemented ‚úÖ

1. **‚úÖ Windows DPAPI Encryption** - Credentials encrypted at rest
2. **‚úÖ File Permission Restrictions** - Credential files limited to SYSTEM/Admins
3. **‚úÖ Path Traversal Prevention** - Comprehensive path validation
4. **‚úÖ Input Validation** - Extensive validation on all inputs
5. **‚úÖ SQL Injection** - N/A (no database)
6. **‚úÖ Command Injection** - SSH commands properly parameterized
7. **‚úÖ File Extension Validation** - Multi-extension bypass protection
8. **‚úÖ Authentication Required** - Windows Auth enforced
9. **‚úÖ Authorization Checks** - Group/user-based access control
10. **‚úÖ Audit Logging** - All security events logged
11. **‚úÖ Secure File Transfer** - SSH with key-based auth (no passwords)
12. **‚úÖ Anti-CSRF Tokens** - ValidateAntiForgeryToken on POST
13. **‚úÖ Log Sanitization** - Sensitive data masked in logs
14. **‚úÖ Resource Limits** - File size, queue size, concurrent operations

## DMZ-Specific Security Recommendations

### Network Security

1. **Firewall Rules:**
   - Inbound: Port 8080 (HTTP) from corporate network only
   - Outbound: Port 22 (SSH) to SCADA network only
   - Block all other traffic

2. **Network Segmentation:**
   - DMZ server should have TWO network interfaces:
     - NIC1: Corporate network (for web portal access)
     - NIC2: SCADA/OT network (for file transfer)
   - No routing between interfaces

3. **Disable HTTPS Redirect** (Already in appsettings.json):
   ```json
   "EnableHttps": false
   ```
   - Use reverse proxy (IIS/nginx) for TLS termination if needed
   - Keeps certificate management separate

### Host Security

1. **Windows Hardening:**
   - Disable unnecessary services
   - Enable Windows Firewall
   - Apply latest security patches
   - Enable Windows Defender

2. **Account Security:**
   - Run services as dedicated service accounts (non-admin)
   - Implement least privilege
   - Regular password rotation for SMB (if used)

3. **File System Security:**
   - `C:\FileRelay\` - Authenticated Users (Read/Write)
   - `C:\ProgramData\ZLFileRelay\` - SYSTEM/Admins only
   - `C:\Program Files\ZLFileRelay\` - Read-only for users

### Monitoring & Alerting

1. **Enable Windows Event Log Monitoring:**
   ```json
   "EnableEventLog": true
   ```

2. **Monitor These Events:**
   - Failed authentication attempts
   - File transfer failures
   - Disk space warnings
   - Service restarts
   - Configuration changes

3. **Log Shipping:**
   - Consider forwarding logs to SIEM
   - Protect against local log tampering
