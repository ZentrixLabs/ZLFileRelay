## 🔧 Architecture Highlights

### Dependency Injection Pattern
```
IFileTransferService (Interface)
    ├─ ScpFileTransferService (SSH/SCP)
    └─ SmbFileTransferService (SMB/CIFS)
    
IFileTransferServiceFactory → Creates appropriate service based on config

TransferWorker → Uses factory → Processes files from queue
```

### Configuration Flow
```
appsettings.json → ZLFileRelayConfiguration → DI Container → Services
```

### Processing Pipeline
```
FileWatcher → FileQueue → TransferWorker → FileTransferService → Destination
                                ↓
                          RetryPolicy (3 attempts)
                                ↓
                          File Verification
                                ↓
                          Archive/Delete (optional)
```

cd src/ZLFileRelay.Service
dotnet run
```

### Configuration
Edit `appsettings.json`:
```json
{
  "ZLFileRelay": {
    "Service": {
      "WatchDirectory": "C:\\FileRelay\\uploads\\transfer",
      "TransferMethod": "ssh"
    },
    "Transfer": {
      "Ssh": {
        "Host": "192.168.1.100",
        "Port": 22,
        "Username": "fileuser",
        "PrivateKeyPath": "C:\\ProgramData\\ZLFileRelay\\ssh_private_key",
        "DestinationPath": "/opt/transfer"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### Installing as Windows Service

## 💡 Lessons Learned

1. **Configuration First** - Define complete configuration model before coding
2. **Interfaces Are Key** - IFileTransferService abstraction makes testing easy
3. **Async All The Way** - Even synchronous operations wrapped for consistency
4. **Security Matters** - Path validation prevented many potential issues
5. **DI Simplifies Testing** - Dependency injection makes mocking trivial
6. **Logging Is Critical** - Structured logging helps debug production issues
