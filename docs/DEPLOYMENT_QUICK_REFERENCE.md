# ZL File Relay - Deployment Quick Reference

## üéØ For DMZ/OT/Air-Gapped Environments

**CRITICAL:** Use self-contained deployment with .NET 8 included!

---

## üöÄ Quick Build for Installer

```powershell
# Run the self-contained publish script
.\build\publish-selfcontained.ps1

# Result: publish/ folder with all components + .NET 8 runtime
# Size: ~150-200MB total
# No .NET installation required on target!
```

---

## üì¶ What Gets Included

| Component | Size | Contents |
|-----------|------|----------|
| **Service** | ~70MB | File Transfer Service + .NET 8 Runtime |
| **Web Portal** | ~75MB | Web Upload Portal + ASP.NET Core 8 Runtime |
| **Config Tool** | ~65MB | Configuration GUI + .NET 8 Runtime (single .exe) |
| **TOTAL** | ~200MB | Everything needed to run on clean Windows |

**Note:** Inno Setup compresses this to ~150MB installer

## ‚úÖ Deployment Workflow

### 1. Build Self-Contained Packages
```powershell
.\build\publish-selfcontained.ps1
```

### 2. (Optional) Security Scan
Submit `publish/` folder contents to security team for scanning

### 3. Create Installer
```powershell
# Use Inno Setup to create single .exe installer
# Points to publish/ folder
# Output: ZLFileRelay-Setup-1.0.0-SelfContained.exe (~150MB)
```

### 4. Deploy to DMZ/OT
```
- Copy installer to target (USB, approved transfer, etc.)
- Run installer
- Configure via Config Tool or appsettings.json
- No internet needed!
```

## üéØ Key Commands

```powershell
# Publish self-contained (includes .NET 8)
.\build\publish-selfcontained.ps1

# Test Service locally
publish\Service\ZLFileRelay.Service.exe

# Test Web Portal locally  
publish\WebPortal\ZLFileRelay.WebPortal.exe

# Launch Config Tool
publish\ConfigTool\ZLFileRelay.ConfigTool.exe

# Build installer (requires Inno Setup)
iscc installer\ZLFileRelay.iss
```

---

## ‚úÖ Verification

After creating self-contained build:

```powershell
# Check Service doesn't need .NET
publish\Service\ZLFileRelay.Service.exe --help

# Check Web Portal doesn't need .NET
publish\WebPortal\ZLFileRelay.WebPortal.exe --urls "http://localhost:5000"

# Check Config Tool doesn't need .NET
publish\ConfigTool\ZLFileRelay.ConfigTool.exe
```

All should run on a machine **WITHOUT** .NET 8 installed!
