# Critical Fixes - Quick Summary

**Date:** October 8, 2025  
**Build Status:** ✅ PASSING

---

## ✅ What Was Fixed

### 1. Alternate Admin Credentials - NOW WORKS! 🎉

**The Problem:**
- UI had username/password fields
- But they didn't do anything!
- Always used current credentials

**The Fix:**
- ✅ Wired up PasswordBox to ViewModel
- ✅ Added credential storage to RemoteServerProvider
- ✅ Modified PowerShell remoting to use alternate credentials
- ✅ Added validation (username & password required)
- ✅ Secure implementation (SecureString)
- ✅ Clear logging (shows which credentials used)

**How to Use:**
1. Go to Remote Server Connection page
2. Uncheck "Use current Windows credentials"
3. Enter admin username: `DOMAIN\adminuser`
4. Enter admin password: `********`
5. Click "Connect"
6. All remote operations now use these credentials!

### 2. Port Availability Check - NOW IMPLEMENTED! 🎉

**The Problem:**
- Pre-flight check always said "Not implemented"
- No way to know if ports were available
- Service could fail to start with no warning

**The Fix:**
- ✅ Implemented real port checking using TcpListener
- ✅ Checks HTTP port (default: 8080)
- ✅ Checks HTTPS port if enabled (default: 8443)
- ✅ Shows specific ports in use
- ✅ Warns before service start failure

**What You'll See:**
```
Pre-Flight Checks:
✅ Configuration File: Valid
✅ Required Directories: All exist
✅ Service Account Permissions: OK
✅ SSH Key File: Accessible
✅ Port Availability: All required ports available (HTTP: 8080)
✅ Disk Space: 45.2 GB available
```

Or if port in use:
```
⚠️ Port Availability: 1 port(s) in use
   HTTP port 8080 is already in use
   The web portal may fail to start if these ports are not released.
```
