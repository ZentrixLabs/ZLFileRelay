# Real-Time Transfer Status Tracking

## Overview

Implemented SignalR-based real-time status tracking for SCADA file transfers. Users now receive instant updates when their uploaded files complete transfer to the SCADA system.

## Implementation Date
October 15, 2025

## Features Implemented

### 1. **Real-Time Status Updates**
- ✅ Instant browser notifications when transfers complete
- ✅ Live status icons that change automatically (Queued → Transferring → Completed/Failed)
- ✅ No page refresh needed - updates happen in real-time
- ✅ Multiple users can see updates simultaneously

### 2. **Status Tracking States**
- **Queued**: File uploaded and waiting for transfer (clock icon)
- **Transferring**: File is currently being transferred to SCADA (spinning icon)
- **Completed**: Transfer successful with destination path shown (check icon)
- **Failed**: Transfer failed with error message displayed (X icon)

### 3. **Architecture**

```

```

## Files Created

### Core Models
- **`src/ZLFileRelay.Core/Models/TransferStatus.cs`**
  - `TransferStatus` enum (Queued, Transferring, Completed, Failed)
  - `FileTransferStatus` class for tracking individual transfers

### WebPortal Components
- **`src/ZLFileRelay.WebPortal/Hubs/TransferStatusHub.cs`**
  - SignalR hub for broadcasting updates to connected clients
  - Supports group subscriptions for specific transfers

- **`src/ZLFileRelay.WebPortal/Services/TransferStatusService.cs`**
  - In-memory transfer status tracking
  - Automatic cleanup of old transfers (1-hour retention)
  - Broadcasts updates via SignalR

- **`src/ZLFileRelay.WebPortal/Services/StatusMonitorService.cs`**
  - Background service that watches for status notification files
  - FileSystemWatcher monitors `.status` directory
  - Processes status files and triggers SignalR updates
  - Automatic cleanup of old status files

### Service Updates
- **`src/ZLFileRelay.Service/Services/TransferWorker.cs`**
  - Added `WriteStatusNotificationAsync()` method
  - Writes `.status.json` files after each transfer
  - Includes both success and failure notifications

### Frontend Updates
- **`src/ZLFileRelay.WebPortal/Pages/Result.cshtml`**
  - Added SignalR JavaScript client
  - Real-time status update UI
  - Animated transitions when status changes
  - Auto-connects to SignalR hub on page load

- **`src/ZLFileRelay.WebPortal/wwwroot/lib/signalr/signalr.min.js`**
  - SignalR client library (47KB)

### Configuration Updates
- **`src/ZLFileRelay.WebPortal/Program.cs`**
  - Registered SignalR services
  - Registered TransferStatusService (singleton)
  - Registered StatusMonitorService (background service)
  - Mapped SignalR hub endpoint: `/hubs/transferstatus`
  - Updated CSP to allow WebSocket connections

## How It Works

### 1. **Upload Phase**
```
User uploads file → FileUploadService saves to watch directory
                  → TransferStatusService registers transfer (Queued)
                  → SignalR broadcasts to all clients
                  → Result page shows "Queued for automatic transfer..."
```

### 2. **Transfer Phase**
```
Service detects file → Starts transfer
                     → Writes {transferId}.status.json file
                     → StatusMonitorService detects file
                     → Updates TransferStatusService (Completed/Failed)
                     → SignalR broadcasts update
                     → Result page updates automatically
```

### 3. **Status Notification File Format**
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "fileName": "data.csv",
  "sourcePath": "C:\\FileRelay\\uploads\\transfer\\jsmith\\data.csv",
  "destinationPath": "root@10.10.4.210:/scada/data.csv",
  "fileSize": 1024,
  "startTime": "2025-10-15T12:00:00",
  "endTime": "2025-10-15T12:00:05",
  "transferMethod": "SSH/SCP",
  "verified": true
}
```

### 4. **Status Directory**
- Location: `{WatchDirectory}\.status\`
- Format: `{transferId}.status.json`
- Automatic cleanup: Files older than 1 hour are deleted
- Example: `C:\FileRelay\uploads\transfer\.status\abc123def456.status.json`

## Transfer ID Generation

Transfer IDs are consistently generated on both sides using the same algorithm:

```csharp
fileName + "_" + lastWriteTime.Ticks → SHA256 hash → Base64 (16 chars)
```

This ensures the Service and WebPortal can correlate status updates without a shared database.

## Configuration

No additional configuration required! The system uses existing settings:

- **Watch Directory**: `ZLFileRelay:Service:WatchDirectory`
- **Status Directory**: Automatically created as `.status` subdirectory
- **Retention Period**: 1 hour (hardcoded, can be made configurable)

## Security Considerations

✅ **Content Security Policy Updated**
- Added `connect-src 'self' ws: wss:` to allow WebSocket connections
- Maintains all other security restrictions

✅ **In-Memory Only**
- Status data kept in memory for 1 hour
- No sensitive data persisted to disk (beyond logs)
- Automatic cleanup prevents memory leaks

✅ **Authenticated Access**
- SignalR hub requires same authentication as web portal
- Users only see updates broadcast to all clients (filename-based matching)

✅ **File System Security**
- `.status` directory created with same permissions as watch directory
- Status files automatically deleted after processing
- Handles locked files gracefully with retry logic

## Testing

### Manual Testing Steps

1. **Start both services:**
   ```powershell
   # Terminal 1 - WebPortal
   cd src\ZLFileRelay.WebPortal
   dotnet run
   
   # Terminal 2 - Service
   cd src\ZLFileRelay.Service
   dotnet run
   ```

2. **Upload a test file:**
   - Navigate to http://localhost:5210/Upload
   - Select a small test file
   - Check "Queue for Automatic Transfer"
   - Click Upload

3. **Observe real-time updates:**
   - On Result page, watch the status line
   - Should see: "Queued..." → "Transferring..." → "Completed!"
   - Status updates should appear within 1-2 seconds of transfer completion

4. **Check browser console:**
   - Press F12 to open developer tools
   - Should see: "Connected to transfer status hub"
   - Should see: "Transfer status update received: {...}"

5. **Verify status files:**
   ```powershell
   # Check status directory
   dir C:\FileRelay\uploads\transfer\.status
   
   # Files should appear briefly and then be deleted
   ```

### Expected Behavior

✅ **Successful Transfer**
- Icon changes: Clock → Spinner → Check
- Color changes: Blue → Blue → Green
- Message: "Transfer completed successfully to {destinationPath}"
- Visual pulse animation on completion

✅ **Failed Transfer**
- Icon changes: Clock → Spinner → X
- Color changes: Blue → Blue → Red
- Message: "Transfer failed: {errorMessage}"

### Troubleshooting

**Issue**: Status doesn't update
- Check browser console for SignalR connection errors
- Verify `.status` directory exists and is writable
- Check WebPortal logs for StatusMonitorService errors
- Verify both services are running

**Issue**: "Failed to connect to hub"
- Check CSP headers in browser Network tab
- Verify `/hubs/transferstatus` endpoint is mapped
- Check firewall isn't blocking WebSocket connections

**Issue**: Transfer ID mismatch
- Verify file timestamp isn't changing between upload and transfer
- Check both Service and WebPortal are using same ID generation logic

## Performance Impact

- **WebSocket Connection**: ~10KB memory per connected client
- **In-Memory Storage**: ~1KB per tracked transfer
- **Cleanup Cycle**: Every 10 minutes (minimal CPU impact)
- **Status Files**: ~1KB per transfer, immediately deleted after processing

## Future Enhancements (Optional)

- [ ] Add transfer progress bar (percentage uploaded)
- [ ] Sound notification on completion
- [ ] Desktop notification API integration
- [ ] User-specific filtering (only show my transfers)
- [ ] Transfer history page with searchable log
- [ ] Export transfer history to CSV
- [ ] Configurable retention period
- [ ] SignalR authentication/authorization per transfer

## Benefits

✅ **Better UX**: Users get instant feedback without refreshing
✅ **No Polling**: Efficient push-based updates (not wasteful polling)
✅ **Scalable**: SignalR handles multiple concurrent users efficiently
✅ **Simple**: No database required, file-based communication
✅ **Reliable**: Status persists in logs even if real-time update fails
✅ **Professional**: Modern real-time web application experience

## Notes

- SignalR uses WebSockets by default, falls back to Server-Sent Events or Long Polling if needed
- Status files provide persistence in case WebPortal restarts mid-transfer
- Logs remain the authoritative source for audit/compliance
- In-memory cache is purely for real-time UX, not for reporting
