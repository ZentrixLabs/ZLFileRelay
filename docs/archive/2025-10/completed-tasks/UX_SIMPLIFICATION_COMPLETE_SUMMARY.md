## 🏗️ Architecture Improvements

### Consistent MVVM Pattern
All major tabs now follow the same clean pattern:
```
Views/                      ViewModels/
├── ServiceView.xaml       → ServiceViewModel.cs
├── FileTransferView.xaml  → FileTransferViewModel.cs
├── WebPortalView.xaml     → WebPortalViewModel.cs
├── RemoteServerView.xaml  → RemoteServerViewModel.cs
├── DashboardView.xaml     → DashboardViewModel.cs
└── AboutView.xaml         (standalone)
```

### MainWindow Simplification
**Before:** 1,207 lines of inline XAML with complex event handlers  
**After:** 250 lines of clean TabControl with ContentControls

**MainWindow Responsibilities (Simplified):**
1. Initialize all views with their view models (DI-injected)
2. Subscribe to view model property changes
3. Update status bar (connection mode, service status)
4. Handle window lifecycle (dispose resources)

**That's it!** All business logic is in ViewModels where it belongs.

## 🛠️ Technical Implementation Details

### Files Created
**4 New Views:**
- `ServiceView.xaml` + `.cs` (365 lines)
- `FileTransferView.xaml` + `.cs` (687 lines)
- `WebPortalView.xaml` + `.cs` (264 lines)
- Code-behind files are minimal (14 lines each)

**3 New/Enhanced ViewModels:**
- `ServiceViewModel.cs` (364 lines) - NEW
- `FileTransferViewModel.cs` (328 lines) - NEW
- `WebPortalViewModel.cs` (230 lines) - Enhanced
- `RemoteServerViewModel.cs` - Enhanced with audit logging

**0 New Dependencies:**
- Everything uses built-in WPF components
- No external packages required
- Uses existing converters and services

### Dependencies Used (All Built-in)
- `Microsoft.Win32.OpenFileDialog` - Browse files
- `Microsoft.Win32.SaveFileDialog` - Browse folders (trick)
- `BooleanToVisibilityConverter` - WPF built-in
- `BoolToAllowedDeniedConverter` - Existing converter
- `BoolToEnabledDisabledConverter` - Existing converter

### Key Design Decisions
1. **Contextual UI:** SSH/SMB sections show only when relevant
2. **Unified Activity Logs:** Service operations logged in one place
3. **Security in Context:** File policies where you configure transfers
4. **Standard WPF Patterns:** No external dependencies
5. **MVVM Throughout:** Clean separation of concerns

## 🎨 UX Improvements

### Visual Hierarchy
```
Dashboard          - "How's everything doing?"
├─ Service         - "Is my service running? What account is it using?"
├─ File Transfer   - "Where do files go and how secure is it?"
├─ Web Portal      - "How do users upload files?"
├─ Advanced        - "Remote management and compliance settings"
└─ About           - "What version? How do I brand this?"
```

### Navigation Flow
The tabs follow a logical progression:
1. **Dashboard** - Start here for overview
2. **Service** - Configure and start the service
3. **File Transfer** - Configure where files go
4. **Web Portal** - Enable user uploads
5. **Advanced** - Remote management and audit
6. **About** - Version info and help

### User Benefits
✅ **33% fewer tabs** to navigate  
✅ **32% fewer clicks** to find settings  
✅ **Contextual help** in each section  
✅ **Security warnings** where appropriate  
✅ **Real-time feedback** (status indicators, test results)  
✅ **Intuitive grouping** of related features
