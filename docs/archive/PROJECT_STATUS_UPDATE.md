## ⏸️ Phase 4: Config Tool - Status

### What Happened
- Started building Modern WPF config tool
- WinUI 3 templates not available via .NET CLI
- Switched to WPF with ModernWPF (solid backup plan)
- Created project successfully
- Hit some CLI path issues when adding packages

### What Exists
```
src/ZLFileRelay.ConfigTool/
├── App.xaml
├── App.xaml.cs  
├── MainWindow.xaml
├── MainWindow.xaml.cs
└── ZLFileRelay.ConfigTool.csproj
```

**Status:** Project shell created, needs packages and implementation

### Options Moving Forward

#### Option 1: Complete in Visual Studio (Recommended)
**Pros:**
- GUI package manager is easier for WPF
- Better XAML designer
- Easier debugging
- Can follow the detailed plan in `docs/PHASE4_WINUI3_IMPLEMENTATION.md`

**Steps:**
1. Open `ZLFileRelay.sln` in Visual Studio
2. Add NuGet packages via GUI:
   - ModernWpfUI (0.9.6)
   - CommunityToolkit.Mvvm (8.2.2)
   - Microsoft.Extensions.DependencyInjection (8.0.0)
   - Microsoft.Extensions.Configuration.Json (8.0.0)
   - SSH.NET (2023.0.1)
   - System.Security.Cryptography.ProtectedData (8.0.0)
3. Follow implementation guide
4. 2-3 days of work

#### Option 2: Use Existing Legacy Tool (Quick Solution)
**Pros:**
- Already has ALL features
- Fully functional
- SSH key generation ✅
- Service management ✅
- Configuration editor ✅
- Service account management ✅

**Location:** `C:\Users\mbecker\GitHub\DMZFileTransferService\ZLBridge.ConfigTool`

**Con:** .NET Framework 4.8, not as modern looking

#### Option 3: Build Later
**Pros:**
- Core services work perfectly
- Can manually edit `appsettings.json`
- Can use Windows SSH command line for key generation
- Focus on deployment/installer first

**Con:** Less convenient

## 📦 What Can Be Deployed Now

### Deployment Option 1: Manual Deployment (Available Now)

**File Transfer Service:**
```powershell
# Publish service
dotnet publish src/ZLFileRelay.Service -c Release -o C:\Services\ZLFileRelay

# Install as Windows Service
sc create ZLFileRelay binPath="C:\Services\ZLFileRelay\ZLFileRelay.Service.exe" start=auto
sc start ZLFileRelay
```

**Web Portal:**
```powershell
# Publish web portal
dotnet publish src/ZLFileRelay.WebPortal -c Release -o C:\inetpub\ZLFileRelay

# Create IIS site
# (Use IIS Manager or PowerShell IIS cmdlets)
```

**Configuration:**
- Copy `appsettings.json` to both locations
- Configure SSH key or SMB credentials
- Set up Windows Authentication in IIS

### Deployment Option 2: With Legacy Config Tool

Use existing `ZLBridge.ConfigTool` to:
1. Generate SSH keys
2. Configure service
3. Install/start Windows Service
4. Set up service account
5. Test connections

Then deploy the new services.

### Deployment Option 3: Build Installer (Phase 5)

Create Inno Setup installer that:
- Installs both services
- Configures IIS
- Registers Windows Service
- Includes config tool
- One-click deployment

### Option B: Build Installer Next (Phase 5)
**Timeline:** 1-2 days  
**Method:** Inno Setup  
**Result:** One-click deployment  
**Tool:** Use legacy config tool or manual config

### Option C: Deploy to Production Now
**Timeline:** 1-2 hours

### Option D: Test SSH Transfer
**Timeline:** 30 minutes  
**Method:** Generate SSH key, configure, test  
**Result:** End-to-end file transfer working

---

## 💡 My Recommendation

**Priority 1:** Test SSH transfer to prove complete workflow
```powershell
# Generate SSH key
ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -f C:\ProgramData\ZLFileRelay\zlrelay_key

# Copy public key to remote server
# Update appsettings.json with key path
# Restart service
# Upload file via web and watch it transfer!
```

**Priority 2:** Build installer (Phase 5)
- Makes deployment easy
- Can include legacy config tool temporarily
- One-click install experience

**Priority 3:** Build modern config tool
- When you have time
- In Visual Studio
- Follow the detailed guide
- Modern experience
