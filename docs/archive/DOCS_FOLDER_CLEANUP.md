# Docs Folder Cleanup - October 8, 2025

## ✅ Cleanup Complete

Eliminated redundant and confusing documentation in the `docs/` folder.

---

## 🎯 Problem Solved

**Before:** Confusing documentation structure
- `NO_IIS_ARCHITECTURE.md` - Says "no IIS needed"
- `IIS_DEPLOYMENT_DMZ_OT.md` - Also says "no IIS recommended"
- `DEPLOYMENT.md` - Generic guide
- `DEPLOYMENT_SELF_CONTAINED.md` - More deployment info
- `WEB_PORTAL_CONFIGURATION.md` - Separate web config
- Multiple overlapping guides

**Result:** Users confused about whether IIS is needed!

---

## ✨ Solution

**After:** Single, clear deployment guide

Consolidated all deployment documentation into **one comprehensive guide**:
- **DEPLOYMENT.md** - Complete deployment guide
  - Makes it clear: **Kestrel standalone by default** (no IIS!)
  - Covers all scenarios (DMZ, OT, Multi-site, Server Core)
  - IIS mentioned only as optional/legacy
  - Single source of truth

---

## 📁 Files Moved to Archive

**Redundant/Technical:**
1. `NO_IIS_ARCHITECTURE.md` → Covered in DEPLOYMENT.md
2. `IIS_DEPLOYMENT_DMZ_OT.md` → Covered in DEPLOYMENT.md (IIS as optional)
3. `DEPLOYMENT_SELF_CONTAINED.md` → Covered in DEPLOYMENT.md
4. `WEB_PORTAL_CONFIGURATION.md` → Covered in CONFIGURATION.md and DEPLOYMENT.md

**Historical/Design:**
5. `PROJECT_ROADMAP.md` → Historical project plan
6. `REMOTE_MANAGEMENT_PLAN.md` → Technical design doc

## ✅ Key Improvements

### 1. Eliminated IIS Confusion
**Before:** Two docs, both saying different things about IIS  
**After:** One doc, makes it clear: **Kestrel standalone by default, IIS optional**

### 2. Consolidated Deployment
**Before:** 4 deployment docs with overlap  
**After:** 1 comprehensive deployment guide + 1 quick reference

### 3. Simplified Structure
**Before:** 14 docs, hard to find what you need  
**After:** 8 docs, each with clear purpose

### 4. Updated for Reality
**Product uses:** Kestrel standalone (no IIS)  
**Old docs said:** Here's IIS, here's no-IIS, choose one?  
**New docs say:** Kestrel standalone by default. Simple.
