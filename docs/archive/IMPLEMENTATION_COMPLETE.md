---

## 🏗️ Build Status

### ConfigTool Build: ✅ **SUCCESS**

```
Build succeeded.
    0 Warning(s)
    0 Error(s)

ZLFileRelay.ConfigTool -> C:\Users\mbecker\GitHub\ZLFileRelay\src\ZLFileRelay.ConfigTool\bin\Debug\net8.0-windows\ZLFileRelay.ConfigTool.dll
```

### Full Solution Build: ⚠️ **File Locks (Services Running)**

The full solution build failed because:
- `ZLFileRelay.Service (PID: 13544)` is running
- `ZLFileRelay.WebPortal (PID: 71664)` is running
- These processes are locking `ZLFileRelay.Core.dll`

**This is expected and not a code issue!** The services just need to be stopped before rebuilding.

## 🎓 Architecture Highlights

### Clean Separation of Concerns
```
ViewModels        → Presentation logic
    ↓
Services          → Business logic
    ↓
Core              → Shared models and interfaces
```

### Dependency Injection
```
App.xaml.cs       → Configure DI container
    ↓
ViewModels        → Injected with services
    ↓
Services          → Injected with dependencies
```

### Configuration Flow
```
Startup           → Load appsettings.json
    ↓
ConfigurationService → Store in CurrentConfiguration
    ↓
ViewModels        → Access shared configuration
    ↓
User Edits        → Update UI properties
    ↓
Save              → Validate and persist
```

## 📝 Notes

### Build Issue
The full solution build failed due to running services holding locks on DLL files. This is a **runtime lock issue**, not a code error.

**To Fix:**
1. Stop ZLFileRelay.Service (PID 13544)
2. Stop ZLFileRelay.WebPortal (PID 71664)
3. Rebuild solution

**Or use Service Manager:**
```
1. Open ConfigTool
2. Navigate to Service Management tab
3. Click "Stop Service"
4. Close WebPortal application
5. Rebuild solution
```

### Platform Warnings
The remaining CA1416 warnings about Windows-specific DPAPI calls are expected and can be ignored for this Windows-only application.
