## 🚀 Next Steps

### To Test SSH Transfer (Needs Admin or SSH Server)
1. Generate SSH key pair OR
2. Configure test SSH server OR
3. Use existing SSH server

### To Test SMB Transfer (No Admin Needed!)
1. Configure SMB path to local directory
2. Drop file in watch folder
3. See it copy automatically!

### For Production Deployment
1. Install as Windows Service (requires admin)
2. Configure real SSH or SMB destination
3. Set up credentials
4. Start service
5. Monitor logs
