# SSH Key Clarification Update

## Summary
Enhanced the SSH key configuration UI and documentation to clarify the difference between private and public keys, and explain the proper setup process when using a Windows service account.

## Changes Made

### 1. UI Enhancements

#### Added Visual Guide
Added a prominent information box in the File Transfer tab explaining:
- **Private Key** - Stays on the local server, used by the service
- **Public Key** - Gets deployed to remote server's `authorized_keys`
- Service account permissions requirements
- Automatic `.pub` extension for public keys

#### Improved Field Labels
- Changed "Private Key Path:" to **"Private Key File:"** with bold styling
- Added tooltip: "Path to SSH private key (WITHOUT .pub extension). Formats: OpenSSH, PEM"
- Added example paths: `C:\ProgramData\ZLFileRelay\ssh\id_ed25519`

#### Enhanced Setup Guide
Updated the expandable "How do I set up SSH?" section with:
- **Part A: Prepare the Service Account**
  - Login as service account once to create profile
  - Grant read access to private key folder
  - Warning about service permissions
  
- **Part B: Generate and Deploy SSH Keys**
  - Generate keys (ED25519 recommended)
  - View and copy public key
  - Deploy to remote server's authorized_keys
  - Test the connection

### 2. Browse Dialog Improvements

#### Better File Filtering
```csharp
Filter = "SSH Private Keys (id_*;*_key;*.pem)|id_*;*_key;*.pem|All Files (*.*)|*.*"
```
- Filters for common SSH key patterns
- Shows private keys by default
- Clear title: "Select SSH Private Key (NOT the .pub file)"

#### Mistake Detection
Automatically warns if user selects a `.pub` file:
```
‚ö†Ô∏è Warning: You selected a public key (.pub) file. 
Please select the PRIVATE key file (without .pub extension) instead.
```

### 3. Improved User Feedback

#### Generate Key Success Message
Now shows:
- ‚úÖ Key format (ED25519)
- üîí Private key location (keep secure)
- üì§ Public key location (deploy to remote)
- Step-by-step next actions
- Security warning about never sharing private key

#### View Public Key Enhancement
Now displays:
- Full path to the `.pub` file
- The public key content
- Clear instructions to copy to `~/.ssh/authorized_keys`
- Reminder to use "Copy to Clipboard" button

### 4. Documentation

#### New Comprehensive Guide
Created `docs/configuration/SSH_KEY_SETUP_GUIDE.md` covering:
- Understanding SSH key pairs
- File formats (OpenSSH, PEM)
- Key types (ED25519 vs RSA)
- Complete setup process
- Service account preparation
- Key generation options
- Public key deployment (Linux and Windows)
- Connection testing
- Common issues and solutions
- Security best practices
- Troubleshooting checklist

## User Experience Improvements

### Before
- ‚ùå Unclear which key file to select
- ‚ùå No explanation of service account requirements
- ‚ùå Could accidentally select .pub file
- ‚ùå Limited guidance on key deployment
- ‚ùå No feedback on file selection

### After
- ‚úÖ Clear explanation of private vs public keys
- ‚úÖ Step-by-step service account setup guide
- ‚úÖ Automatic warning if .pub file selected
- ‚úÖ Detailed deployment instructions for both Linux and Windows
- ‚úÖ Immediate feedback on key selection
- ‚úÖ Visual guide always visible during configuration
- ‚úÖ Example paths and file formats shown
- ‚úÖ Comprehensive troubleshooting documentation

## Key Clarifications Addressed

### 1. Which File to Browse?
**Answer:** Browse for the **PRIVATE** key file (WITHOUT `.pub` extension)
- Examples: `id_ed25519`, `zlrelay_key`, `key.pem`
- The public key is automatically found at `{private_key_path}.pub`

### 2. Service Account Requirements
**Answer:** The service account needs:
1. A user profile (login once with `runas /user:DOMAIN\account cmd`)
2. Read access to the private key file
3. The private key stored in an accessible location

### 3. Key Formats Supported
**Answer:** 
- **OpenSSH format** (default, recommended) - Generated by `ssh-keygen`
- **PEM format** (legacy) - Older format, still supported
- **ED25519 keys** (recommended) - Modern, secure
- **RSA keys** (legacy) - Older, still works

### 4. Where Keys Are Stored
**Default Location:**
- Private: `C:\ProgramData\ZLFileRelay\ssh\zlrelay_key`
- Public: `C:\ProgramData\ZLFileRelay\ssh\zlrelay_key.pub`

**Remote Server:**
- Linux: `/home/username/.ssh/authorized_keys`
- Windows: `C:\Users\username\.ssh\authorized_keys`

## Migration from Old ZLBridge

### Old Behavior
- Had separate fields for private and public key paths
- Less guidance on service account setup
- Manual file selection without validation

### New Behavior
- Single private key field (public key auto-detected)
- Comprehensive setup guide built into UI
- Automatic validation and warnings
- Better feedback and error messages

### Compatibility
‚úÖ Old keys work fine - just browse to the private key file
‚úÖ Same OpenSSH format used
‚úÖ Same ssh-keygen.exe used for generation

## Testing Performed

- ‚úÖ Generate new ED25519 key pair
- ‚úÖ View public key content
- ‚úÖ Copy public key to clipboard
- ‚úÖ Browse dialog filters correctly
- ‚úÖ Warning displays when .pub file selected
- ‚úÖ Paths auto-fill after generation
- ‚úÖ Setup guide is clear and comprehensive

## Files Modified

### Code Changes
- `src/ZLFileRelay.ConfigTool/Views/FileTransferView.xaml`

  - Enhanced setup guide
  - Improved field labels and examples
  
- `src/ZLFileRelay.ConfigTool/ViewModels/FileTransferViewModel.cs`
  - Improved browse dialog filtering
