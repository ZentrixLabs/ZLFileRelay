## 🔥 CRITICAL VULNERABILITIES ELIMINATED

### 1. Remote Code Execution (CRITICAL-1) ✅
**Severity:** 🔴 CRITICAL  
**Impact:** Complete system compromise  
**Status:** FIXED

**The Vulnerability:**
- PowerShell script injection via username parameter
- Attacker could execute arbitrary commands with admin privileges

**The Fix:**
- Converted to parameterized PowerShell execution
- Uses `ExecuteCommandAsync` with parameter dictionary
- PowerShell handles all escaping automatically

**Files:** `ServiceAccountManager.cs` (+158 lines)

---

### 2. Credential Exposure (CRITICAL-2) ✅
**Severity:** 🔴 CRITICAL  
**Impact:** Credential theft by any user  
**Status:** FIXED

**The Vulnerability:**
- Service account passwords passed as command-line arguments
- Visible in Task Manager, Process Explorer, Event Logs

**The Fix:**
- Replaced sc.exe with WMI via PowerShell
- Password converted to SecureString (encrypted in memory)
- Passed as parameter object, not command-line text

**Files:** `ServiceAccountManager.cs` (same file as above)

---

## ⚠️ HIGH SEVERITY ISSUES RESOLVED

### 3. DPAPI Scope Mismatch (HIGH-1) ✅
**Severity:** ⚠️ HIGH (Production Blocker)  
**Impact:** Service cannot access credentials  
**Status:** FIXED

**The Problem:**
- Credentials encrypted with CurrentUser scope
- ConfigTool (Admin) saves, Service (svc_account) can't read
- **Application literally broken in production!**

**The Fix:**
- Changed to LocalMachine scope
- Added file ACL protection (SYSTEM + Administrators only)
- Migration message for existing installations

**Files:** `CredentialProvider.cs` (+91 lines)

---

### 4. Authorization Validation (HIGH-2) ✅
**Severity:** ⚠️ HIGH  
**Impact:** Misconfiguration not obvious  
**Status:** FIXED

**The Problem:**
- No validation that authorization is configured
- Unclear error messages for admins

**The Fix:**
- Explicit check for empty allow lists
- Clear ERROR: "No authorization rules configured!"
- Better UX for troubleshooting

**Files:** `AuthorizationService.cs` (+38 lines)

---

### 5. UNC Path Traversal (HIGH-3) ✅
**Severity:** ⚠️ HIGH  
**Impact:** Access to unintended files  
**Status:** FIXED

**The Problem:**
- No validation of server names
- Could inject: `evil.com\share\..\..\..\Windows\System32`

**The Fix:**
- Added `IsValidServerName()` validation
- Supports: IPv4, IPv6, hostnames
- Blocks: path traversal characters

**Files:** `ConfigurationService.cs` (+80 lines)

---

## ⚙️ MEDIUM SEVERITY IMPROVEMENTS

### 6. Log Sanitization (MEDIUM-1) ✅
- Created `LoggingHelper.cs` utility class
- Sanitizes SSH keys, AD groups, file paths
- Prevents information disclosure in logs

### 7. CSRF Protection (MEDIUM-2) ✅
- Added anti-forgery tokens to upload forms
- Blocks cross-site request forgery attacks
- Industry standard web security

### 8. SSH Host Validation (MEDIUM-3) ✅
- Enhanced to accept IP addresses (IPv4/IPv6)
- Better validation logic
- Improved UX

### 9. Rate Limiting (MEDIUM-4) ✅

- Configurable limit (10 uploads/min default)
- Prevents upload DoS attacks

### 10. File Extension Validation (MEDIUM-5) ✅
- Enhanced to detect double extensions
- Blocks alternate data streams
- Prevents null byte injection
