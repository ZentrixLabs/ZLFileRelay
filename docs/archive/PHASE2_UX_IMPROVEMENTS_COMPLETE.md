### 6. Consolidated Log Viewer ⏳
**Status:** DEFERRED  
**Reason:** Existing log outputs in Service Management and Service Account tabs are sufficient for Phase 2

**Current Logging:**
- Service Management tab has Activity Log
- Service Account tab has Operations Log
- SSH tab has test result output
- Pre-flight checks have detailed logs

**Future Enhancement:**
- Could add unified log viewer in Phase 3 if needed
- Current per-tab logs work well for their contexts
