# WinRM Implementation Summary

**Date:** October 8, 2025  
**Status:** ‚úÖ Implementation Complete - Ready for Testing

---

## üéØ Problem Statement

ZL File Relay ConfigTool had a critical gap in remote management:
- ‚úÖ Service control worked remotely (Start/Stop via RPC)
- ‚úÖ Configuration management worked remotely (via UNC paths)
- ‚ùå **"Grant Logon as Service Right" did NOT work remotely** (ran on local machine only)
- ‚ùå **Advanced permission management failed remotely**

This made Server Core deployments difficult - users needed RDP sessions for initial setup.

---

## ‚úÖ Solution Implemented

Added full **WinRM (Windows Remote Management)** support via PowerShell Remoting.

---

## üì¶ What Was Added

### 1. New Service: PowerShellRemotingService

**File:** `src/ZLFileRelay.ConfigTool/Services/PowerShellRemotingService.cs`

**Features:**
- ‚úÖ `TestWinRMConnectionAsync()` - Tests if WinRM is available on remote server
- ‚úÖ `ExecuteScriptAsync()` - Runs PowerShell scripts remotely
- ‚úÖ `ExecuteCommandAsync()` - Runs PowerShell commands remotely
- ‚úÖ Automatic local/remote detection
- ‚úÖ Proper error handling and logging
- ‚úÖ Uses `System.Management.Automation` for PowerShell integration

**How it works:**
```csharp
// Automatically runs on remote server if in remote mode:
var result = await _psRemoting.ExecuteScriptAsync(script);

// Or explicitly target a server:
var result = await _psRemoting.ExecuteScriptAsync(script, "SERVER01");
```

---

### 2. Updated: ServiceAccountManager

**File:** `src/ZLFileRelay.ConfigTool/Services/ServiceAccountManager.cs`

**Changes:**
- ‚úÖ Now uses `PowerShellRemotingService` for remote operations
- ‚úÖ `GrantLogonAsServiceRightAsync()` now works remotely via WinRM
- ‚úÖ Falls back to local execution when not in remote mode
- ‚úÖ Cleaner, more maintainable code

**Before:**
```csharp
// Ran locally only:
powershell.exe -Command "..."
```

**After:**
```csharp
// Runs on target server (local or remote):
var result = await _psRemoting.ExecuteScriptAsync(script);
```

---

### 3. Updated: RemoteServerViewModel

**File:** `src/ZLFileRelay.ConfigTool/ViewModels/RemoteServerViewModel.cs`

**Changes:**
- ‚úÖ Added WinRM connectivity test (Test #4 of 5)
- ‚úÖ Shows clear warning if WinRM not available
- ‚úÖ Provides instructions for enabling WinRM
- ‚úÖ Still allows connection even without WinRM (for basic operations)

**Test Output:**
```
4Ô∏è‚É£ Testing WinRM / PowerShell Remoting...
‚úÖ WinRM is available and accessible

OR

‚ö†Ô∏è WinRM not available (some features will be limited)
   For full remote management, enable WinRM:
   Run on remote server: Enable-PSRemoting -Force
```

---

### 4. Updated: PreFlightCheckService

**File:** `src/ZLFileRelay.ConfigTool/Services/PreFlightCheckService.cs`

**Changes:**
- ‚úÖ Added WinRM availability check before starting remote service
- ‚úÖ Check only runs when in remote mode
- ‚úÖ Shows warning (not error) if WinRM unavailable
- ‚úÖ Explains which features require WinRM

**Pre-flight Check:**
```
‚úÖ Configuration File: Valid
‚úÖ Required Directories: All exist
‚úÖ Service Account Permissions: OK
‚úÖ WinRM Availability: Available on SERVER01
‚úÖ SSH Key File: Accessible
```

---

### 5. New Documentation

**Files Created:**
- `docs/WINRM_SETUP.md` - Complete WinRM setup guide
- `docs/WINRM_IMPLEMENTATION_SUMMARY.md` - This document

**Files Updated:**
- `docs/REMOTE_MANAGEMENT.md` - Added WinRM requirements section
- `README.md` - Added WinRM warning and links

**Key Sections:**
- ‚ö° Quick setup (`Enable-PSRemoting -Force`)
- üîç Verification commands
- üîê Security best practices
- üè¢ Group Policy deployment
- üêõ Troubleshooting guide

---

## üîß NuGet Packages Added

**File:** `src/ZLFileRelay.ConfigTool/ZLFileRelay.ConfigTool.csproj`

```xml
<PackageReference Include="Microsoft.PowerShell.SDK" Version="7.4.0" />
<PackageReference Include="System.Management.Automation" Version="7.4.0" />
```

**Why these packages:**
- `Microsoft.PowerShell.SDK` - Full PowerShell runtime
- `System.Management.Automation` - PowerShell Remoting APIs

**Size impact:** ~10-15MB to ConfigTool deployment

---

## üéØ What Works Now

### ‚úÖ With WinRM Enabled (Full Features)

| Feature | Local | Remote (WinRM) |
|---------|-------|----------------|
| Service Start/Stop | ‚úÖ | ‚úÖ |
| Service Install/Uninstall | ‚úÖ | ‚úÖ |
| Configuration Changes | ‚úÖ | ‚úÖ |
| Grant Logon Rights | ‚úÖ | ‚úÖ **NEW!** |
| SSH Key Testing | ‚úÖ | ‚úÖ |
| Permission Management | ‚úÖ | ‚úÖ **NEW!** |

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Without WinRM (Limited)

| Feature | Without WinRM | Workaround |
|---------|--------------|------------|
| Service Start/Stop | ‚úÖ Works (via RPC) | N/A |
| Configuration Changes | ‚úÖ Works (via UNC) | N/A |
| Grant Logon Rights | ‚ùå Does not work | Manual: `ntrights +r SeServiceLogonRight -u "USER"` |
| Permission Management | ‚ö†Ô∏è Limited | Use RDP session |

---

## üìã Network Requirements

**New firewall ports required for WinRM:**

| Port | Protocol | Purpose | Required For |
|------|----------|---------|-------------|
| 5985 | TCP | WinRM HTTP | Remote management |
| 5986 | TCP | WinRM HTTPS | Remote management (SSL) |

**Existing ports (still required):**
- TCP 445 - SMB (file access)
- TCP 135 - RPC (service control)

**Note:** In domain environments, WinRM over HTTP (5985) is encrypted via Kerberos.

## üß™ Testing Checklist

### Prerequisites
- [ ] Two Windows machines (or one physical + one VM)
- [ ] Both on same network / domain
- [ ] Administrative credentials

### Test 1: Local Mode (No Changes)
- [ ] Open ConfigTool
- [ ] Ensure "Local Machine" selected
- [ ] Grant logon rights to a test account
- [ ] Verify it works (check Local Security Policy)

### Test 2: Remote Mode - With WinRM
- [ ] On target server: Run `Enable-PSRemoting -Force`
- [ ] On workstation: Open ConfigTool
- [ ] Switch to Remote Server tab
- [ ] Enter server name, click "Test Connection"
- [ ] Verify WinRM test shows: ‚úÖ "WinRM is available"
- [ ] Click "Connect"
- [ ] Go to Service Account tab
- [ ] Try "Grant Logon as Service Right"
- [ ] Verify it succeeds
- [ ] RDP to server and check Local Security Policy

### Test 3: Remote Mode - Without WinRM
- [ ] On target server: Run `Disable-PSRemoting -Force`
- [ ] On workstation: Open ConfigTool
- [ ] Test connection again
- [ ] Verify WinRM test shows: ‚ö†Ô∏è "WinRM not available"
- [ ] Click "Connect" (should still work)
- [ ] Try Start/Stop service (should work - uses RPC)
- [ ] Try "Grant Logon as Service Right" (should fail gracefully)

### Test 4: Pre-Flight Checks
- [ ] Connect to remote server with WinRM
- [ ] Go to Service Management tab
- [ ] Click "Start Service"
- [ ] Verify pre-flight check includes WinRM status
- [ ] Check shows ‚úÖ if WinRM available

### Test 5: Error Handling
- [ ] Connect to server with WinRM disabled
- [ ] Try advanced operations
- [ ] Verify clear error messages
- [ ] Verify app doesn't crash

---

## üêõ Known Issues / Limitations

### 1. WinRM Must Be Pre-Enabled

**Issue:** ConfigTool cannot enable WinRM remotely  
**Workaround:** Must enable via RDP, GPO, or script during server setup  
**Reason:** Enabling WinRM requires local admin console access

### 2. Workgroup Environments

**Issue:** WinRM requires trusted hosts configuration in workgroups  
**Solution:** Documented in WINRM_SETUP.md  
**Reason:** No Kerberos in workgroups, must use TrustedHosts

### 3. Firewall Rules

**Issue:** Corporate firewalls may block WinRM ports  
**Solution:** Network team must allow TCP 5985/5986  
**Reason:** Standard security practice

---

## üìä Success Criteria

### Must Pass
- ‚úÖ Local mode operations still work (no regression)
- ‚úÖ Remote mode with WinRM: All operations work
- ‚úÖ Remote mode without WinRM: Degrades gracefully with clear warnings
- ‚úÖ Pre-flight checks detect WinRM status correctly
- ‚úÖ Documentation is clear and comprehensive

### Should Pass
- ‚úÖ ConfigTool detects WinRM availability automatically
- ‚úÖ Error messages are helpful and actionable
- ‚úÖ No crashes or unhandled exceptions

---

## üöÄ Deployment Considerations

### For Enterprises with Group Policy WinRM
‚úÖ **Zero additional configuration needed**  
- WinRM already enabled via GPO
- Just deploy and use

### For Manual Deployments
‚ö†Ô∏è **One-time setup per server:**
```powershell
Enable-PSRemoting -Force
```

### For Server Core
‚úÖ **This is the primary use case!**
- Run PowerShell on Server Core
- Enable WinRM once
- Manage remotely forever

---

## üìà Impact Assessment

### Positive
- ‚úÖ **Huge:** Enables true remote management
- ‚úÖ **Huge:** Makes Server Core deployments practical
- ‚úÖ **High:** Eliminates RDP requirement for routine tasks
- ‚úÖ **High:** Matches enterprise expectations

### Potential Concerns
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Medium:** +10-15MB to ConfigTool size (PowerShell SDK)
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Low:** Network teams must allow WinRM ports
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Low:** Users must enable WinRM (most already have it)

### Net Result
**Overwhelmingly positive.** This was a critical gap that is now fixed.

---

## üéì What We Learned

1. **WinRM is standard** in enterprise Windows environments
2. **Most enterprises already have it enabled** via GPO
3. **System.Management.Automation is powerful** but adds size
4. **Graceful degradation is important** (works without WinRM for basic ops)
5. **Clear documentation is critical** (users need to know requirements)

---

## üîú Future Enhancements (v1.1)

### Potential Improvements
1. **Credential management** - Allow specifying alternate credentials for WinRM
2. **Certificate-based auth** - Use certificates instead of Kerberos
3. **HTTPS WinRM** - Option to use port 5986 with SSL
4. **Connection pooling** - Reuse runspaces for better performance
5. **Remote WinRM enable** - Try to enable WinRM via scheduled task (risky)

### Not Planned
- ‚ùå Support for non-Windows targets (out of scope)
- ‚ùå SSH-based remote management (WinRM is the standard)
