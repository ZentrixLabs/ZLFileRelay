# Credential Separation Implementation

**Date:** October 8, 2025  
**Issue:** Ensure remote connectivity credentials never use service account credentials  
**Status:** ✅ Complete

---

## Problem Statement

The ConfigTool's remote connectivity section has a "Use Credentials" checkbox. We needed to ensure that this functionality:

1. ✅ Uses **current user credentials** (default)
2. ✅ Uses **alternate admin credentials** (optional, explicitly provided)
3. ❌ **NEVER** uses service account credentials

The service account credentials are for running the ZLFileRelay service itself, not for remote management operations. Mixing these two credential types would be a serious security and architectural issue.

---

## Changes Implemented

### 1. Code Documentation and Clarification

#### `PowerShellRemotingService.cs`
Added explicit comments in the `CreateRunspaceAsync` method:

```csharp
// IMPORTANT: Always use current user credentials or explicitly provided admin credentials
// NEVER use service account credentials for remote management operations
// If UseCurrentCredentials is true (default), the current user's context is used
// If alternate credentials are provided, they will be set via connectionInfo.Credential
```

**Location:** Lines 185-188

#### `RemoteServerViewModel.cs`
Added comprehensive documentation to the credentials properties:

```csharp
// IMPORTANT: These credentials are for REMOTE MANAGEMENT ONLY
// They represent either:
//   1. Current user credentials (UseCurrentCredentials = true) - Default
//   2. Alternate admin credentials (UseCurrentCredentials = false) - Explicit override
// These should NEVER be confused with service account credentials used by the ZLFileRelay service
```

**Location:** Lines 24-28

#### `IRemoteServerProvider.cs`
Added interface-level documentation:

```csharp
/// IMPORTANT: This interface provides ONLY server connection details.
/// It does NOT handle credentials. Remote management credentials are handled separately:
///   - Current user credentials (default) - provided by Windows authentication
///   - Alternate admin credentials - provided via PowerShell remoting
///   - Service account credentials - NEVER used for remote management (only for ZLFileRelay service itself)
```

**Location:** Lines 6-10

#### `ServiceAccountManager.cs`
Added class-level and method-level documentation with logging:

```csharp
/// <summary>
/// Manages the service account credentials for the ZLFileRelay Windows Service.
/// 
/// IMPORTANT: Service account credentials managed by this class are ONLY for running 
/// the ZLFileRelay service itself. They are NOT used for remote management operations.
/// Remote management uses either current user credentials or explicit admin credentials.
/// </summary>
```

Added logging to track credential usage:

```csharp
_logger.LogInformation("Setting service account credentials for ZLFileRelay service: {Username}", username);
_logger.LogDebug("Note: Service account credentials are NOT used for remote management operations");
```

**Location:** Lines 12-18, 95-97

### 2. UI Improvements

#### `RemoteServerView.xaml`
Enhanced the credentials section with:

1. **Clearer labels and warnings:**
   ```xml
   <!-- Credentials for Remote Management -->
   ```

2. **Explicit warning messages:**
   ```xml
   Use your current Windows credentials for remote management. 
   Note: These are NOT the service account credentials - those are configured separately.
   ```

3. **Added alternate credentials UI (disabled when using current credentials):**
   ```xml
   <!-- Alternate Admin Credentials (optional) -->
   <StackPanel IsEnabled="{Binding UseCurrentCredentials, Converter={StaticResource InverseBoolConverter}}">
       <TextBlock Text="Alternate Admin Credentials:" Margin="0,5,0,5" FontWeight="SemiBold"/>
       <TextBlock TextWrapping="Wrap" Margin="0,0,0,5" Foreground="Gray" FontSize="11">
           Provide administrator credentials if different from your current login.
           Do NOT enter service account credentials here.
       </TextBlock>
       ...
   </StackPanel>
   ```

**Location:** Lines 48-69

### 3. Comprehensive Documentation

#### Created: `docs/CREDENTIAL_MANAGEMENT.md`
A complete guide covering:

- **Overview** - Two distinct credential types
- **Remote Management Credentials** - Purpose, types, usage
- **Service Account Credentials** - Purpose, details, usage
- **Critical Security Rules** - What to never do and always do
- **Code Implementation** - Code examples
- **UI Indicators** - What users see
- **Troubleshooting** - Common issues and solutions
- **Summary Table** - Quick reference

#### Updated: `docs/REMOTE_MANAGEMENT.md`
Added prominent warning at the top:

```markdown
> **⚠️ Important:** For information about credentials used in remote management, 
> see **[Credential Management Guide](CREDENTIAL_MANAGEMENT.md)**. 
> Remote management credentials are completely separate from service account credentials.
```

#### Updated: `docs/README.md`
Added Credential Management to the documentation index:

- Added to "Advanced Features" section
- Added to "By Task → Management" section
- Added to "By Role → Security Team" section

#### Updated: `docs/DOCUMENTATION_STRUCTURE.md`
Added CREDENTIAL_MANAGEMENT.md to the advanced features list.

## Security Guarantees

### Current Implementation

1. **PowerShell Remoting** - Uses Windows authentication by default
   - `WSManConnectionInfo` created without explicit credentials
   - Uses the current user's security context
   - Service account credentials are never accessible from this code path

2. **Service Account Management** - Completely separate code path
   - Only used by `ServiceAccountManager.SetServiceAccountAsync()`
   - Only passed to `sc.exe config` command
   - Never passed to remote management functions
   - Explicit logging tracks when service credentials are used

3. **UI Separation** - Different pages/sections
   - Remote Server Connection page - Remote management credentials
   - Service Account page - Service credentials
   - Clear warnings on both pages

### Architectural Separation

```
Remote Management Credentials
├── Handled by: RemoteServerViewModel
├── Used by: PowerShellRemotingService
├── Storage: Not stored (per-session only)
└── Purpose: Connect to remote servers

Service Account Credentials
├── Handled by: ServiceAccountViewModel
├── Used by: ServiceAccountManager
├── Storage: Windows Service Manager (encrypted by Windows)
└── Purpose: Run the ZLFileRelay service
```

**No code path connects these two credential types.**

## Testing Verification

### Build Status
✅ Build successful with no errors (only pre-existing warnings)

```
Build succeeded.
10 Warning(s)
0 Error(s)
```

All warnings are pre-existing platform and nullable reference warnings, unrelated to credential handling.

### Manual Verification Checklist

- [x] Code documentation added with clear warnings
- [x] UI labels and warnings updated
- [x] Comprehensive documentation created
- [x] Documentation index updated
- [x] Build succeeds without errors
- [x] Architectural separation maintained
- [x] Logging added to track credential usage

## Developer Guidelines

When working with credentials in the ConfigTool:

### ✅ DO:
- Use current user credentials by default for remote operations
- Allow explicit alternate admin credentials only when needed
- Keep remote management and service account credentials completely separate
- Document which credentials are being used in logs
- Add warnings in UI when credentials are involved

### ❌ DON'T:
- Pass service account credentials to PowerShell remoting
- Store remote management passwords (use per-session only)
- Confuse the two credential types in code or documentation
- Expose service account credentials through remote management APIs

## Summary

The credential separation has been successfully implemented with:

1. **Code-level safeguards** - Clear documentation and separation
2. **UI-level clarity** - Warnings and labels prevent confusion

4. **Architectural integrity** - No code path connects the two credential types

**Result:** Remote connectivity will only use current user credentials or explicitly provided admin credentials, never service account credentials.
