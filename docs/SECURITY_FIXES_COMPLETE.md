## 🔐 Security Vulnerabilities Eliminated

### 1. ✅ PowerShell Injection (CRITICAL)
**Before:** Attackers could inject malicious PowerShell commands  
**After:** Parameterized execution prevents all injection attacks  
**Benefit:** Remote code execution impossible

### 2. ✅ Password in Command Line (CRITICAL)
**Before:** Passwords visible in Task Manager, Event Logs  
**After:** SecureString + WMI, never exposed  
**Benefit:** Credential theft eliminated

### 3. ✅ DPAPI Scope Mismatch (HIGH)
**Before:** Service couldn't decrypt credentials (BROKEN!)  
**After:** LocalMachine scope + file ACLs  
**Benefit:** Production deployments now work correctly

### 4. ✅ Authorization Validation (HIGH)
**Before:** Misconfiguration not obvious to admins  
**After:** Clear ERROR messages, explicit validation  
**Benefit:** Faster troubleshooting, better UX

### 5. ✅ UNC Path Validation (HIGH)
**Before:** Path traversal via server name injection  
**After:** Regex validation blocks all injection attempts  
**Benefit:** Defense in depth against social engineering
