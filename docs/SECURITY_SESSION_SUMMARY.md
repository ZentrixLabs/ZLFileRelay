## 💻 Technical Implementation Summary

### Pattern: Parameterized Execution
**Applied to:** PowerShell commands, SQL queries (if any)
```csharp
// Never do this:
command.Replace("$param", userInput)  // ❌

// Always do this:
ExecuteWithParameters(command, new Dictionary<string, object> {
    { "param", userInput }  // ✅
})
```

### Pattern: SecureString for Passwords
**Applied to:** Service account configuration
```csharp
var securePassword = new SecureString();
foreach (char c in password) securePassword.AppendChar(c);
securePassword.MakeReadOnly();
// Pass as parameter object, not text
```

### Pattern: LocalMachine DPAPI
**Applied to:** Credential storage
```csharp
ProtectedData.Protect(data, null, DataProtectionScope.LocalMachine);
// + File ACLs for access control
```

### Pattern: Input Validation
**Applied to:** File names, server names, usernames
```csharp
// Validate format first
if (!IsValid(input)) throw new ArgumentException();
// Then process
```

### Pattern: Log Sanitization
**Applied to:** All sensitive logging
```csharp
_logger.LogDebug("Data: {Data}", LoggingHelper.Sanitize(sensitiveData));
```
