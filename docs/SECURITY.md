# Security

**ZL File Relay** implements enterprise-grade security practices for secure file transfer operations.

## Security Features

### Authentication & Authorization
- **Windows Authentication** - Integrated with Active Directory
- **Group-Based Access Control** - Configurable user and group permissions
- **Role-Based Authorization** - Separate controls for upload and management
- **Session Management** - Secure session handling

### Credential Management
- **DPAPI Encryption** - Windows Data Protection API for credential storage
- **LocalMachine Scope** - Cross-user credential access for service accounts
- **File ACL Protection** - Credentials accessible only to SYSTEM and Administrators
- **SecureString Handling** - Passwords encrypted in memory
- **No Plaintext Storage** - All credentials encrypted at rest

### File Transfer Security
- **SSH Key Authentication** - Preferred over password authentication
- **Strict Host Key Checking** - Prevents man-in-the-middle attacks
- **Transfer Verification** - File integrity validation after transfer
- **Secure File Deletion** - Optional source file deletion after successful transfer

### Web Portal Security
- **HTTPS Support** - TLS 1.2+ encryption
- **Anti-CSRF Protection** - Anti-forgery tokens on all forms
- **Rate Limiting** - Prevents denial-of-service attacks (configurable)
- **Input Validation** - Comprehensive file and path validation
- **File Extension Control** - Configurable allow/block lists
- **Size Limits** - Configurable maximum file sizes

### Input Validation
- **Path Traversal Prevention** - Blocks `..`, relative paths, UNC traversal
- **Filename Sanitization** - Removes dangerous characters
- **Extension Validation** - Prevents double extensions and alternate data streams
- **Server Name Validation** - Validates hostnames and IP addresses
- **Command Injection Prevention** - Parameterized execution throughout

### Logging & Auditing
- **Structured Logging** - Serilog with configurable levels
- **Audit Trail** - All security-relevant operations logged
- **Log Sanitization** - Sensitive data (keys, passwords, paths) redacted
- **Retention Policies** - Configurable log retention

## Security Best Practices

### Deployment
1. **Run service as dedicated service account** - Never as Administrator
2. **Use SSH key authentication** - Avoid password-based auth
3. **Enable HTTPS** - Configure TLS certificates
4. **Configure firewall rules** - Restrict access to necessary ports
5. **Regular updates** - Keep .NET runtime and dependencies current

### Configuration
1. **Strong service account passwords** - 15+ characters, complex
2. **Minimal permissions** - Grant only necessary access
3. **Secure credential storage** - Use the built-in credential provider
4. **Configure authorization** - Define AllowedUsers or AllowedGroups
5. **Enable audit logging** - Monitor security events

### Monitoring
1. **Review logs regularly** - Check for unauthorized access attempts
2. **Monitor failed authentications** - Detect brute force attempts
3. **Track file transfers** - Audit what was transferred and by whom
4. **Watch for rate limiting** - Monitor HTTP 429 responses
5. **Alert on errors** - Configure alerts for security failures
