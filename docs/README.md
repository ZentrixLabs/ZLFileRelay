## Architecture Overview

ZL File Relay consists of three main components:

1. **Windows Service** (`ZLFileRelay.Service`)
   - Monitors directories for new files
   - Transfers files via SSH/SCP or SMB
   - Runs as a background Windows Service
   - Configurable retry logic and error handling

2. **Web Portal** (`ZLFileRelay.WebPortal`)
   - ASP.NET Core web application
   - User-friendly file upload interface
   - Windows Authentication
   - Hosted in IIS

3. **Configuration Tool** (`ZLFileRelay.ConfigTool`)
   - WPF desktop application
   - Unified configuration management
   - Service control (start/stop/restart)
   - Remote server management via WinRM
   - Test connections and credentials

All components share the same configuration file (`appsettings.json`) for consistency.
