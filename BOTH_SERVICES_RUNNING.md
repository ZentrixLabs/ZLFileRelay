User → Web Portal → Upload File → Save to Watch Directory → Service Detects → Queue → Transfer → Destination
```

**Live Example:**
1. User navigates to http://localhost:5141
2. Selects file(s) to upload
3. Web portal saves to C:\FileRelay\uploads\transfer\[username]\file.txt
4. File Transfer Service detects the file instantly
5. Queues file for processing
6. Waits for file stability (2 seconds)
7. Creates appropriate transfer service (SSH or SMB)
8. Transfers file with retry logic
9. Verifies transfer
10. Archives or deletes source

**All of this is WORKING RIGHT NOW!** 🔥
