### Migration from 1.0.0

#### For Existing Installations

**If using IIS deployment:**
1. Uninstall ZL File Relay 1.0.0
2. Remove IIS site configuration (if desired)
3. Install ZL File Relay 1.1.0
4. Web Portal will install as Windows Service
5. Configure authentication:
   - For domain environments: Use Entra ID
   - For air-gapped/DMZ: Use Local Accounts
   - For hybrid: Enable both

**Authentication migration:**
- Previous Windows Authentication users: Switch to Entra ID (if cloud-connected)
- Air-gapped users: Use Local Accounts (create users via registration or ConfigTool)
- No automatic user migration (users need to re-register or use Entra ID)

**Configuration changes:**
- Update `appsettings.json` with new `Authentication` section
- Update `WebPortal` section with port configuration
- Run ConfigTool to configure authentication via wizard

### Security

#### Enhancements
- Local account passwords hashed with ASP.NET Core Identity (PBKDF2)
- Entra ID OAuth 2.0 tokens encrypted at rest
- Session cookies are HTTP-only and secure (if HTTPS enabled)
- Role-based authorization prevents privilege escalation
- Admin approval workflow prevents unauthorized access

#### Notes
- **Air-gapped environments**: Local Accounts provide full authentication without internet
- **Cloud-connected environments**: Entra ID provides SSO and centralized user management
- **Hybrid deployments**: Enable both for maximum flexibility

### Technical Details
- ASP.NET Core Identity for local user management
- Microsoft.Identity.Web for Entra ID integration
- SQLite database for local accounts (located in C:\ProgramData\ZLFileRelay)
- HTTP.sys for URL reservations (managed by ConfigTool)
- Kestrel web server (production-ready, high-performance)
- Font Awesome Free (migrated from Pro for open source compatibility)

## Version History

### Version 1.1.0 (October 31, 2025)
**Major Architecture Update - Kestrel & Hybrid Authentication**

**Breaking Changes:**
- Web Portal no longer uses IIS - now runs as Windows Service with Kestrel
- Windows Authentication removed - replaced with Local Accounts and/or Entra ID
- Active Directory no longer required

**Key Features:**
- Kestrel-based web hosting (no IIS dependency)
- Hybrid authentication: Local Accounts + Entra ID (Microsoft 365)
- Perfect for air-gapped/DMZ environments (local accounts work offline)
- SQLite user database for local authentication
- User registration with optional admin approval
- Role-based access control
- Simplified deployment (no IIS configuration)
- Works on Windows Server Core without GUI

**Why This Update:**
This release eliminates two major deployment barriers:
1. **IIS Requirement** - Many DMZ/OT environments don't allow IIS or prefer simpler architectures
2. **Domain Dependency** - Cross-domain authentication in DMZ scenarios was complex; local accounts provide offline capability

**Migration Required:** Existing 1.0.0 users must uninstall and reinstall. Users will need to re-authenticate using local accounts or Entra ID.
